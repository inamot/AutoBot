# Interactive Auto Mapping Tool

A prototype implementation of an algorithm that automatically maps source code artifacts to a high level architectural representation using user feedback.


This proptotype has an automated evalutor to measure the performance of the algorithm.

Open source java-based tests systems have been uploaded with their respective config files that allow you to set parameters that the evaluator can use to test the performance of the algorithm.

To view the results of an evaluation you need to open the algo-eval-results.html file using a browser that allows CORS, see https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2016/09/disable-same-origin-policy/update readme
