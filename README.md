# AutoBot: Automated Interactive Code-to-Architecture Mapping Recommendations

Reflexion Modelling is a popular method used in industry for Software Architectural Consistency Checking (SACC). However, it involves a mapping step that is manual and tedious. There exist techniques and tools that attempt to automate mapping, yet they are either limited in their approach or they require an initial set of manually pre-mapped entities. This study proposes a novel technique, AutoBot, that improves the mapping process in reflexion modelling by both providing versatility and eliminating the constraint of needing a set of manually pre-mapped entities in order to automate mapping. Using a software’s architecture descriptions, AutoBot applies information retrieval concepts to the software’s source code to interactively provide mapping recommendations to an architect.

The replication package includes a prototype that has an automated evaluator to measure the performance of the algorithm in terms of recall and precision.
