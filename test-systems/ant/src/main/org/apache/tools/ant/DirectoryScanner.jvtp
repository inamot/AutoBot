   class scanning directory files directories match certain 
   criteria  
    p criteria consist selectors patterns specified selectors select files want included  
   files not selected excluded patterns include exclude files based filename  
    p idea simple given directory recursively scanned files directories  each file directory matched against set selectors  
   including special support matching against filenames include and exclude patterns  only files directories match least one 
   pattern include pattern list file selector don't match 
   any pattern exclude pattern list fail match against required 
   selector placed list files directories found  
    p list include patterns supplied used means everything matched list exclude patterns supplied empty list used nothing excluded selectors supplied  none applied  
    p filename pattern matching done follows name matched split up path segments path segment name directory file bounded code file separator  code   ' ' under unix  '\' under windows example   abc def ghi xyz java split up segments  abc   
    def   ghi xyz java same done pattern against matched  
    p segments name pattern matched against each used path segment pattern matches 
   zero path segments name  
    p special case regarding use code file separator  code s beginning pattern string match  br pattern starts code file separator  code string match must start code file separator  code pattern not start code file separator  code string match may not start code file separator  code one rules not obeyed string not 
   match  
    p name path segment matched against pattern path segment following special characters used  br  
   ' ' matches zero characters br  
   '?' matches one character
