   plays sound file end build  according whether build failed succeeded three attributes set  
   
    code source  code location audio file played 
    code duration  code   play sound file continuously until  duration  milliseconds expired 
    code loops  code number times sound file played until stopped only tested wav aiff sound file formats  both seem work fine  
   
   plans future  
   - use midi api define sounds drum beat etc xml ant play back
